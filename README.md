# Cheer-Bot-for-Discord
Instructions:
- on Windows use pip3 install command to download discord, requests and json
- get token for your discord bot and place it in the .env file as shown in .env.example file
- And once you run it, the bot will activate.

I will put this app on the cloud so it won't require local computer to run to run the chat bot and make the chat bot public so anyone can add it to their 
discord server. I may add more features to it later on.
